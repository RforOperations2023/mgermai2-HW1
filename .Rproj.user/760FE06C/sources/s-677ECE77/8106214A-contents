# Homework #1 -- Building a Basic Shiny App

## General Description

This is my first of three homework assignments for CMU's Spring 2023 "R for Operations Management" course.

## Assignment Details and Directions

Nearly every Shiny application requires you to translate user inputs to allow them to manipulate the data you visualize for them. For this assignment you must use data from an open data website (you may download and clean the data and write it as a CSV).

### Directions:

* Create three (3) different kinds of plots/figures
* Use DT to create one (1) data table
* Include at least two (2) different types of inputs
* One (1) functioning downloadButton()
* Inputs must use reactivity in a logical manner with all outputs displayed to users

## Data Source

The data source I used is courtesy of the [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/).

The specific dataset I used is [here](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/prt-monthly-average-ridership-by-route/resource/12bb84ed-397e-435c-8d1b-8ce543108698)

## Improvements I Would Make in the Future

There are a few general improvements I would make to this project, given more time and familiarity with R and R Shiny:

* I would use the [scales](https://scales.r-lib.org/) library to create more detailed scales for the plots.  For example, it would be nice to have the x-axis of the first plot include smaller tick marks for the months in-between the years that it does display.
* I would make the x-axis on all three plots more readable.  Unfortunately, I was unable to figure out how to do this in a timely manner.
* I would add a more descriptive title to the legend of the two bar plots.
* I would order the bars of the two bar plots from most ridership to least ridership.  I would also ensure that the legend ordered appropriately as well when I implement this functionality.
